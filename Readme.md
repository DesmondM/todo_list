1.Warm up challenge
In this challenge you are going to create a drag and drop TODO app, to set the task to complete a user should drag it to the complete column. There will be two columns (on the left the task column – current and on the right the complete column). Dragging back to the left should take the state to not complete (bonus)
• The user of the TODO app should be able to add tasks
• Remove (delete)
• Set to complete (drag to another column)
• Edit TODO (optional bonus)
